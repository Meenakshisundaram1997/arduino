Arduino Fun Projects

I did these projects while I was in college with two of my friends. We had just learnt what an arduino was and was excited to build something with it. Simply put
Arduino is a microcontroller with lot of input and output peripherals, which enables programming a microcontroller with simple software.
When I was searching for something else in amazon, I came across this LED Matrix module
(https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00QVFDHHG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which can be interfaced with arduino uno and thought it would be fun if we build some games we had played in nokia mobiles during our child hood using arduino UNO and this LED Matrix module and also had four push buttons to get the input from the user.

So we built two games snake and ping pong.
