Arduino Fun Projects

I did these projects while I was in college with two of my friends. We had just learnt what an arduino was and was excited to build something with it. 
When I was searching for something else in amazon, I came across this LED Matrix module
(https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00QVFDHHG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and thought it would be fun if we build some games we had played in nokia mobiles during our child hood using arduino and this LED Matrix module and also had four push buttons to control the input from the user.

So we built two games snake and ping pong.
